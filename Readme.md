# The Gossip Project

A little gossip generator, with a database!
There are 4 kinds of pages :
* index.erb -- the main page which shows the current gossips.
* new_gossip.erb -- from which you can create and save new ones.
* gossip_page.erb -- for each gossip.
* edit.erb -- to edit any change for all the saved gossips.

I couldn't have the editing done properly, though!


### Installing
Please install the bundle to install all the gems :
```
bundle install
```
You can then use the shotgun gem:
```
shotgun -p 4567
```
